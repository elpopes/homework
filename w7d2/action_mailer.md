Action Mailer Basics
Action Mailer allows you to send emails from your application. There are two parts:

An ApplicationMailer class extending ActionMailer::Base. This works similarly to ApplicationController extending ActionController::Base. Mailers live in app/mailers.
Views, which live in app/views/<mailer_name>.
Your first mailer
To set up a mailer, you first need to have Action Mailer installed. By default, Rails will include Action Mailer in any new project. If you create a project using the --minimal flag, however, Action Mailer is one of the packages that will be skipped. In this latter case, you can enable its features by uncommenting require "action_mailer/railtie" in config/application.rb. That's it! Now Action Mailer is ready to go.

Generate the mailer
You can generate mailers with a Rails generator, just like you generate a model. The generator will create the mailer, the view, and--if you have tests activated--tests:

% rails g mailer User
create app/mailers/user_mailer.rb
invoke erb
create app/views/user_mailer
invoke test_unit
create test/functional/user_mailer_test.rb
create test/mailers/previews/user_mailer_preview.rb
If you created your app with the --minimal flag and only activated Action Mailer later, then generating your first mailer will also create the base ApplicationMailer class in app/mailers/application_mailer.rb and some basic HTML and text email layout templates (app/views/layouts/mailer.text.erb and app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb).

Edit the mailer
The ApplicationMailer from which your UserMailer inherits contains a default from address:

# app/mailers/application_mailer.rb

class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
default from: 'from@example.com'

# layout 'mailer'

end
Meanwhile, app/mailers/user_mailer.rb contains a completely empty mailer:

# app/mailers/user_mailer.rb

class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
end
To send a welcome email to a user's registered email address, you can add a method called welcome_email like this:

# app/mailers/user_mailer.rb

class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
def welcome_email(user)
@user = user
@url = 'http://example.com/login'
mail(to: user.email, subject: 'Welcome to My Awesome Site')
end

def reminder_email(user) # ...
end

# other emails...

end
Somewhat like a controller, this adds a mailer action that will send a welcome_email to the passed user. You set the to and the subject (as well as from, which here is set from the inherited default). The content of the email lives in a view (more in a sec) which will be rendered.

You can also set cc and bcc attributes. In order to send to multiple emails, use an array of email strings.

You can put the name of the recipient in the email address like so: "Ned Ruggeri <ned@appacademy.io>". This is a nice way of personalizing your email. Likewise you should personalize the sender: "App Academy <contact@appacademy.io>".

The mail method returns an email object (of type Mail::Message). It doesn't mail the email, however. Instead, the caller of UserMailer#welcome_email will call #deliver_now on the Message object:

# app/controllers/users_controller.rb

def create
u = User.create(user_params)

    msg = UserMailer.welcome_email(u)
    msg.deliver_now

    render :root

end
Create a mailer view
Wait. What about the content? Create a file called welcome_email.html.erb in app/views/user_mailer/. This will be the template used for the email, formatted in HTML:

<!-- app/views/user_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to example.com, <%= @user.name %>!</h1>
    <p>
      You have successfully signed up to example.com.
      Your username is: <%= @user.login %>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To log in to the site, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
Just like controllers, any instance variables you define in the method become available for use in the views.

It is also a good idea to make a text version for this email. People who don't like HTML emails should have a text version to view. Also, spam filters will ding you if you don't have a text version; a lot of email gets flagged as spam, so this is a problem.

To do this, create a file called welcome_email.text.erb in app/views/user_mailer/:

<%# app/views/user_mailer/welcome_email.text.erb %>

# Welcome to example.com, <%= @user.name %>!

You have successfully signed up to example.com.
Your username is: <%= @user.login %>.

To log in to the site, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.

Thanks for joining and have a great day!
When you call the mail method now, Action Mailer will detect the two templates (text and HTML) and automatically generate a multipart/alternative email. The user's email client will be able to choose between the two formats.

Warning: Mailing is slow
Sending out an email often takes up to 1 sec. This is kind of slow. In particular, if your Rails app is sending mail as part of a controller action, the user will have to wait an extra second for the HTTP response to be sent.

You'll eventually learn how to "batch up" and send emails offline, but for now just know that if you try to send 100 emails in a controller action, you're going to have trouble responding to requests promptly.

Mailing Details
Adding Attachments
Adding attachments is pretty simple: just add new key/value pairs to the hash-like attachments variable. This is provided in each instance of ActionMailer::Base, which comes through ApplicationMailer.

# app/mailers/user_mailer.rb

def welcome_email
attachments['filename.jpg'] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg') # ...
end
Generating URLs in Action Mailer views
You will probably want to embed URLs into your mailer views just like in your controller views. Somewhat oddly, you must set an option in config/environments/production.rb (and config/environments/development.rb for development) so that the mailer knows the base url of the website:

# config/environments/development.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' }

# config/environments/production.rb

config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'www.production-domain.com' }
(If you do not need to differentiate between development and production environments, you can instead include the default url option in config/application.rb.)

You would think that the Rails app would know the hostname. After all, you don't have to set this option to use \*\_url methods in controller views. Nevertheless, as the Rails Guides - Action Mailer Basics inform,

"Unlike controllers, the mailer instance doesn't have any context about the incoming request so you'll need to provide the :host parameter yourself."

Make sure to (continue to) use the _\_url form of the url helpers and not the _\_path form. When a user opens their email, the email needs to contain the full hostname of the site to know what host to send the request to. This is because the email is being opened by a mail client that isn't on the same domain as your site (e.g., the email is opened on gmail.com but the link needs to point to appacademy.io).

Letter opener gem
Testing email sending in development can be a pain. Use the wonderful letter_opener gem. When running the development environment (your local machine), instead of sending an email out to the real world, letter_opener will instead pop open the "sent" email in the browser.

Setup is two lines:

# Gemfile

gem 'letter_opener', group: :development

# config/environments/development.rb

config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
