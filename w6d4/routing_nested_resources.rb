# Routing II: Nested Resource Routes
# It's common to have resources that are "children" of other resources. For example, suppose that your application includes these models:

# app/models/magazine.rb
class Magazine < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :articles
end

# app/models/article.rb
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :magazine
end

# Nested routes allow you to capture this relationship in your routing. In this case, you could include this route declaration:

# # config/routes.rb
# NewspapersApp::Application.routes.draw do
#   resources :magazines do
#     # provides a route to get all the articles for a given magazine.
#     resources :articles, only: :index
#   end

#   # provides all seven typical routes
#   resources :articles
# end
# This generates a /magazines/:magazine_id/articles route. Requests for this route will be sent to the ArticlesController#index action.

# Here's what the ArticlesController might look like:

class ArticlesController
  def index
    if params.has_key?(:magazine_id)
      # index of nested resource
      @articles = Article.where(magazine_id: params[:magazine_id])
    else
      # index of top-level resource
      @articles = Article.all
    end

    render json: @articles
  end
end


# The nested resource has a dynamic segment parameter, :magazine_id, that will capture which magazine is in view.


# Restricting nested member routes
# You can restrict what routes you build for a resource using the :only option. The code above tells the nested resource to generate only the index route.

# If you didn't specifically restrict the routes, Rails would generate all the typical routes for the nested resource:

# Collection Routes:
index: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles
new: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/new
create: POST /magazines/:magazine_id/articles

# Member routes
show: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/:id
edit: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/:id/edit
update: PUT /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/:id
update: PATCH /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/:id
destroy: DELETE /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/:

#Here's a general design principle: there should be exactly one URL which maps to the representation of a resource. The URLs /articles/101 and /magazines/42/articles/101 would both route to the same Article. One of these is superfluous.

# The /magazines/42 bit of the /magazines/42/articles/101 path is also redundant. ArticlesController#show doesn't need the magazine id to find the article; it can just use the article id directly. If you wish to use the magazine_id, you can always look it up from the article id:

Article.find(id).magazine_id

# As a general rule, never generate any of the member routes when nesting; member routes should only belong to top level resources. Note, however, that there's nothing wrong with defining the same resource at two levels.

Nested collection routes
# You now have three remaining collection routes you might nest:

index: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles
new: GET /magazines/:magazine_id/articles/new
create: POST /magazines/:magazine_id/articles

# Nested index routes are often helpful because they perform a distinct action. For example, the nested article index above should return all the articles in the given magazine. This is different from the top-level /articles index route, which should return all the articles in the system. Because it returns a subset, /magazines/:magazine_id/articles does not repeat the top-level index route's behavior in the way nested member routes do.

# Nesting new and create routes simply means that you can grab the outer resource's id from the URL. For example, /magazines/123/articles/new should return a form to create an Article for Magazine #123; a non-nested new route would require that the returned form have a field to specify the particular magazine in which the article appears. Similarly, a nested article create route could grab the magazine's id from the URL whereas a top-level create route would require that information to be submitted in the request body. (Once you get to React, you may find that using top-level create routes helps to simplify your React components.)

# Shallow nesting
# The idea that you should only nest collection routes is so conventional that Rails even provides a shorthand way to achieve this result: the :shallow option. For example, the discussion above recommends structuring your magazine and article routes like this:

resources :magazines do
  resources :articles, only: [:index, :new, :create]
end
resources :articles, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
which produces the following routes:

              Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                                    Controller#Action

                     DELETE /magazines/:id(.:format)                       magazines#destroy
        edit_article GET    /articles/:id/edit(.:format)                   articles#edit

                     DELETE /articles/:id(.:format)                        articles#destroy
# You can produce the same routes using the :shallow option on the nested resource:

resources :magazines do
  resources :articles, shallow: true
end
# The :shallow option will nest the specified resource's collection routes but create top-level member routes:
