# Rails Parameter Conventions

# Rails stores parameters in an ActionController::Parameters object that you can access by calling params. While an ActionController::Parameters object is not a hash, it is hash-like, meaning that it will respond to most Hash methods (because the developers have similarly defined those methods on ActionController::Parameters too). In other words, in most cases, you can simply treat params as if it returned a Hash.

# As you've seen in the previous sections, values from forms can be at the top level of the params object or nested in an internal hash-like structure. For example, in a standard create action for a Person model, params[:person] is expected to be a hash-like object of all the attributes for the person to create. params can also contain arrays, arrays of hash-like objects, and so on. (For constructing such parameters, see below.)

# Fundamentally, HTML forms don't know about any sort of structured data: all they generate is nameâ€“value pairs, where pairs are just plain strings. The arrays and hash-like objects you see in your application are the result of some parameter naming conventions that Rails uses.

# TIP: You may find you can try out examples in this section faster by using the console to directly invoke Rack's parameter parser. For example:

[1] pry(main)> Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query('name=fred&phone=0123456789')
=> {"name"=>"fred", "phone"=>"0123456789"}
[2] pry(main)> Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query('user[name]=fred&user[phone]=0123456789')
=> {"user" => { "name"=>"fred", "phone"=>"0123456789"} }
[3] pry(main)> Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query('languages[]=Ruby&languages[]=JavaScript')
=> {"languages"=>["Ruby", "JavaScript"]}

# Basic structures: Hash
# The two basic structures are arrays and hashes (technically, hash-like objects). Hashes mirror the syntax used for accessing the value in params. For example, if a form contains

<input id="person_name" name="person[name]" type="text" value="Henry">

# params will return an object that looks like this:

{ 'person' => { 'name' => 'Henry' } }

# params[:person][:name] will then retrieve the submitted value in the controller.

# These hash-like objects can be nested as many levels as required, e.g.:

<input id="person_address_city" name="person[address][city]" type="text" value="New York">

# will result in the params object being

{ 'person' => { 'address' => { 'city' => 'New York' } } }


# Basic structures: Arrays
# Normally Rails ignores duplicate parameter names. For instance, if your form contains:

<input type="hidden" name="key" value="value1">
<input type="hidden" name="key" value="value2">

# then on submission, the browser will send:

key=value1&key=value2

# When Rails goes to parse this, it will return:

{ 'key' => 'value2' }

# The last value wins; Rails overwrites any prior values. Note that Rails is the one which does this: the browser is happy to upload multiple values for the same name.

# When you want Rails to build an array, you append an empty set of square brackets to the name:

<input name="person[phone_numbers][]" type="text" value="555-123-4567">
<input name="person[phone_numbers][]" type="text" value="555-765-4321">
<input name="person[phone_numbers][]" type="text" value="555-135-2468">

# Rails will parse the uploaded params as

{ 'person' => {
    'phone_numbers' => [
      '555-123-4567',
      '555-765-4321',
      '555-135-2468'
    ]
  }
}

# Similarly, you can create an array of hash-like objects like this:

<input name="persons[][phone_number]" type="text" value="555-123-4567">
<input name="persons[][phone_number]" type="text" value="555-765-4321">
<input name="persons[][phone_number]" type="text" value="555-135-2468">

# Rails will parse these uploaded params as

{ 'persons' => [
    { 'phone_number' => '555-123-4567' },
    { 'phone_number' => '555-765-4321' },
    { 'phone_number' => '555-135-2468' }
  ]
}
