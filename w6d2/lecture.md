What's the difference between class variables and instance variables
Everytime we define a class we're creating an instance of the class class
what's send?
what's define_method?

what's metaprogramming?
often used to dynamically define a suite of similar methods vased on undescted future...
makes use of a collection of methods

Maacros
example:
attrs
dynamically defines getters
has_many?
validates
Coding defines behavior

an instance is not an instance of class but of the instance of the class instance.
