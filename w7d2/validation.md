Validation
For sundry reasons, data saved to the database needs to be validated. Model level validations are the most common, but validations can be created on the controller level or on the client side in JavaScript. Database constraints can also be added to the database to prevent bad input.

Performing the validations at the model level has these benefits:

Database agnostic
Convenient to test and maintain
Nice, specific, per-field error messages
Avoids reliance on database constraints (which throw nasty errors)
ActiveRecord::Base instance methods that run validations:

#create
#create!
#save
#save!
#update
#update!
Model-Level Validation
Let's consider a User class with basic validations for username and password.

class User < ApplicationRecord
validates :username, :password, presence: true
validates :password, length: { minimum: 6 }
end
So if you run

u = User.new(username: 'Billy Bob')
u.save
u.save will run validations. After completing the validations the u.errors attribute will contain a hash with all of the errors, by attribute.

=> { password: ["can't be blank", "is too short (minimum is 6 characters)"]}
flash vs flash.now
Data stored in flash will be available to the next controller action and can be used when redirecting.

Data stored in flash.now will only be available in the view currently being rendered by the render method.

Flash Hash

Rendering Errors
One common way to render errors is to store them in flash[:errors] after running validations. You can then display them on the page by iterating through each of the errors. Note that flash can be used as a hash and :errors is just an arbitrary--though semantically meaningful!--key.

If you follow the pattern of always storing obj.errors.full_messages in flash[:errors], then you can use a partial to render the flash errors on each form.

Controller
Let's make a simple controller that will store any validation errors in a flash[:errors] array.

def create
@user = User.new(params[:user])
if @user.save
flash[:notice] = 'Success!'
redirect_to user_url(@user)
else # sweet! now flash.now[:errors] will be full of informative errors!
flash.now[:errors] = @user.errors.full_messages
render :new
end
end
View
When the new or edit pages are rendered, also render a list of all of the errors, if any.

<!-- layouts/_errors.html.erb -->

<% if flash.now[:errors] %>
<% flash.now[:errors].each do |error| %>
<%= error %><br />
<% end %>
<% end %>

<!-- views/users/new.html.erb -->

<%= render partial: 'layouts/errors' %>

<!-- views/users/edit.html.erb -->

<%= render partial: 'layouts/errors' %>
Notice how trivial it is to add the list of errors to future new/edit pages by using a partial.

Introducing the 4 H’s
So how do we write, or rewrite, our error messages to keep our users on track?

It’s not that difficult, really. We just need to consider the 4 H’s of writing error messages.

Error messages need to be:

Human
Helpful
Humorous
Humble
