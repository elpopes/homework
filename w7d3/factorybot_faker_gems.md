# FactoryBot and Faker Gems

## Better Fixtures With FactoryBot And Faker

To test the functionality of your models, you will first need to create instances. You could do something like this:

```
# BAD

cat = Cat.create(
name: 'Fluffy',
color: 'Dark Brown',
email: 'meow@meow.com',
owner_id: 1,
active: true,
temperament: 'mild'
)

# ... test stuff about the cat object
```

However, you want to avoid having all of that clutter in your test code each time you need to work with a cat for testing purposes. One solution to this problem is Rails's built-in fixtures, but they have some downsides of their own.

## FactoryBot

The best solution is to use factories. FactoryBot is the top library for replacing fixtures. It allows you to write:

```
# GOOD

cat = FactoryBot.build(:cat)
```

The cat object will be created using default values for its attributes, which are defined by a factory like so:

```
# spec/factories/cats.rb

FactoryBot.define do
    factory :cat do # The name matters. A :cat factory returns a Cat object.
        name 'Fluffy'
        color 'Dark Brown'
        email 'meow@meow.com'
        owner_id 1
        active true
        temperament 'mild'
    end
end
```

These default values can be selectively overridden:

```
evil_cat = FactoryBot.build(:cat, temperament: 'malicious')

# evil_cat.temperament => "malicious"

# evil_cat.name => "Fluffy"
```

This allows you to write to-the-point tests:

```
# spec/models/cat_spec.rb

RSpec.describe Cat, type: :model do
    it 'is valid when required attributes are present' do
        expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat)).to be_valid
    end

context 'is invalid' do
        specify 'when name is blank' do
            expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat, name: '')).not_to be_valid
        end # ...
    end
end
```

## Faker

All of your cats will be named Fluffy, have the same email, color, etc., unless you individually override these attributes. This homogeneity might be undesirable. Faker gem to the rescue! It generates filler data like names, phone numbers, and Lorem Ipsum. You can use it to make your factories dynamic rather than static.

You'll see more examples soon, but, first, let's get set up.

### Setting up FactoryBot and Faker

You can set up FactoryBot and Faker in just three steps:

1. Set up RSpec for your Rails application (see the "RSpec and Rails Setup" reading).
2. In the **Gemfile**, add gem 'factory_bot_rails' and gem 'faker' under group :development, :test:

   ```
   # Gemfile

   group :development, :test do
       gem 'factory_bot_rails'
       gem 'faker'
   end
   ```

   (If you only want to use Faker in testing--and **NOT**, e.g., in your **seeds.rb** file--then you can just include it under group :test instead.)

3. Run bundle install to install the faker and factory_bot_rails gems.

Finally, if you don't want to prefix each FactoryBot method call with FactoryBot, add config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods in your **rails_helper.rb** file:

```
RSpec.configure do |config|
    config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
end
```

Then you can call, e.g., build(:user) instead of FactoryBot.build(:user) in your specs.

## Using FactoryBot and Faker

In this section, you will learn how to use FactoryBot and Faker.

### Setting up Factories

To use FactoryBot with RSpec, define each factory in a separate file inside the **spec/factories** directory. If you have set up RSpec, the model generator will automatically create a factory spec file **<pluralized_model_name>.rb** for the generated model (e.g., spec/factories/users.rb). Otherwise, create your own file with a similarly formatted name.

Suppose you have a `Post` model with `title`, `subtitle`, `random_num`, and `published` attributes. When defining attributes on a factory, you must pass the attribute's value in a block so that each attribute will be generated dynamically.

A typical factory setup would accordingly look like this:

```
# spec/factories/posts.rb

FactoryBot.define do
    factory :post do # Again, the name matters. A :post factory returns a Post object.
        title { 'It\'s a title!' } # Enclose all attribute values inside blocks
        subtitle { '~also has a subtitle~' }
        random_num { 1 + rand(100) }

        # Child of :post factory since it's nested in the `factory :post` block
        # :published_post inherits the preceding attributes from :post
        factory :published_post do
            published { true }
        end

    end
end
```

The above code would enable you to create published posts like this:

```
published_post = FactoryBot.build(:published_post)
published_post.title # => "It's a title!"
published_post.published # => true
Note that, in the above code, published is not defined on :post. FactoryBot.build(:post).published will therefore be nil.
```

For more information on FactoryBot, see the docs.

## Using Faker

The faker gem is a module of methods that generate randomized fake data in specific formats. It can generate names, addresses, phone numbers, business and product names, and more. Some quick examples:

```
[1] pry(main)> require 'faker'
=> true

[2] pry(main)> Faker::Commerce.product_name
=> "Ergonomic Steel Shoes"

[3] pry(main)> Faker::Internet.domain_name
=> "haley.org"

[4] pry(main)> Faker::Name.name
=> "Neal Deckow"
The faker documentation has details about all the data types available.
```

### Testing model validations

Start with the most basic factory to satisfy your model validations. In other words, if you have no required attributes for cat, then your factory could look like this:

```
# spec/factories/cats.rb

FactoryBot.define do
    factory :cat do
    end
end
```

And your test could look like this:

#spec/cat_spec.rb

```
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Cat, type: :model do
    it 'has no required attributes' do
        expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat)).to be_valid
    end
end
```

What if your model has many specific validations and required attributes? Consider this case:

```
# app/models/cat.rb

class Cat < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, presence: true, format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z\s\.]+\z/,
        message: 'only allows letters and spaces' }, length: { minimum: 3 },
        uniqueness: true
    validates :color, presence: true, inclusion: { in: %w(red blue green yellow brown black white orange),
        message: "%{value} is not a valid color for a cat." }
    validates :age, presence: true, numericality: { only_integer: true,
        less_than: 100, message: 'Cat age must be a number below 100.' }
    validates :temperament, presence: true, exclusion: { in: %w(evil mean),
        message: 'No bad cats allowed!' }
end
```

In this case, you need to explicitly create attributes in the factory which satisfy the validations, like this:

```
# spec/factories/cats.rb

FactoryBot.define do
factory :cat do
name 'Garfield'
color 'orange'
age 53
temperament 'sarcastic'
end
end
```

### Overwriting attributes in your test

A valid model factory can easily be overwritten to test invalid instances of the model:

```
# spec/models/cat_spec.rb

# ...

it 'must have a name' do
    expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat, name: nil)).not_to be_valid
end

# ...
```

Passing in a hash of attributes and values for the second argument of `FactoryBot#build`, `FactoryBot#create`, and similar methods will overwrite those attributes for the model.

```
# spec/models/cat_spec.rb

require 'rails_helper'

# fully testing the name validations

RSpec.describe Cat, type: :model do
    context 'when name is invalid' do
        it 'should require a name' do
            expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat, name: '')).not_to be_valid
        end

        it 'should only accept letters and spaces in name' do
            expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat, name: '1337-H4x0r')).not_to be_valid
        end

        it 'should require a name longer than 2 letters' do
            expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat, name: "Bo")).not_to be_valid
        end
    end

# ... (more validation tests would follow)

end
```

### Generating many randomly populated instances of a model

If you want to generate a large batch of test data, you most likely want different attributes for each entry (rather than having 100 users with the name 'John Doe').

To generate random names for your test users, you must pass a block that generates a random name string. This is where Faker comes in handy:

# spec/factories/puppies.rb

FactoryBot.define do
factory :puppy do
name { Faker::Name.name }
end
end

You can even ensure that the random names will be unique by passing `Faker::Name.unique.name` inside the block instead. (For more on generating unique values with Faker, see [here].(https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker#ensuring-unique-values)

In the RSpec test, you can now generate or build multiple records.

Models with associations
Using a sequence is an easy way to generate associated models with unique values because sequences give you an iterator.

Example: Creating a cat with an associated hat.

(This assumes you have already set up the hat.rb model file, the create_hats... table migration, and the one-to-one association between cats and hats.)

# spec/factories/cats.rb

FactoryBot.define do
factory :cat do
sequence :hat do |n|
FactoryBot.build(:hat, hat_name: "top-hat #{n}")
end
end
end
This example also uses FactoryBot sequences to add an iterator.

You can test the association in this case by calling #hat on the generated cat:

# spec/cat_spec.rb

RSpec.describe Cat, type: :model do

# ...

it 'may wear a hat' do
expect(FactoryBot.build(:cat).hat).to be_instance_of(Hat)
end
end

## `FactoryBot.build` vs. `FactoryBot.create`

`FactoryBot.build(:factory_name)` returns an object that is not written to the database. `FactoryBot.create(:factory_name)` will write the created record to the database; it is therefore slower than build. Prefer build unless you have a need to write to the database.
