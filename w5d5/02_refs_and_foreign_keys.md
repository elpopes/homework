references And Foreign Keys
So far, you have set up foreign keys in your databases simply by declaring a column of type bigint with a name that ends in \_id. (You should also set up an index for any foreign key.) That will always work, but Rails also provides some syntactic sugar for declaring foreign keys: references.

Learning goals
In this reading you will learn how to use the references type to

Set up an \_id column of type bigint
Index that column (or not)
Set a foreign_key constraint on that column that links to the correct table
Set up belongs_to associations in the model
references
For any column that you want to use as a foreign key, you should designate the type as references. For example, using references in a model generator looks like this:

rails g model Course name:string instructor:references
This command will produce the following migration and model files:

# db/migrate/20220518192247_create_courses.rb

class CreateCourses < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
def change
create_table :courses do |t|
t.string :name
t.references :instructor, null: false, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end

end
end

# app/models/course.rb

class Course < ApplicationRecord
belongs_to :instructor
end
Look at all that references does for you! It automatically adds null: false and foreign_key modifiers. (More on the foreign_key designation below.) A column of type references also takes an index option that defaults to true, meaning that this migration will create an index on instructor. And it adds belongs_to associations to the model file it creates! (You will still have to add the has_many--and any other--associations.)

Running the migration
Running the above migration will produce the following schema:

create_table "courses", force: :cascade do |t|
t.string "name"
t.bigint "instructor_id", null: false
t.datetime "created_at", null: false
t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
t.index ["instructor_id"], name: "index_courses_on_instructor_id"
end

# ...

add_foreign_key "courses", "instructors"
Several points are worth noting:

references appears nowhere in the schema; it is strictly syntactic sugar for your migration. The columns indicated as references in the migration will be type bigint in the schema / database.

The references columns in the migration have no \_id after their names. \_id is automatically appended, however, in the schema / database. It is important to get this naming right. NEVER append \_id to the name of any column in your migration whose type is references.

Since the column in the database will have the \_id at the end of its name, if you need to reference that column in the migration--e.g., as an argument for add_index--you should append the \_id.

Rails assumes that your migration uses conventional naming. It accordingly assumes that instructor_id points to an instructors table. (See, e.g., the add_foreign_key statement.) That is probably not what you want in this case.

Because of the foreign_key constraints, this migration will not run successfully unless you have already created an instructors table in your database.

You will read more about foreign_key constraints (#5) below, but first it will be helpful to address the issue with unconventional names (#4) and an additional potential issue with indexes.

to_table
To have a reference point to a table with an unconventional name, you simply tell Active Record which table to use by setting the to_table option on foreign_key. For example, if instructor actually points to a users table, you would adjust your base migration like this:

# db/migrate/20220518192247_create_courses.rb

class CreateCourses < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
def change
create_table :courses do |t|
t.string :name
t.references :instructor, null: false, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }

      t.timestamps
    end

end
end
Running this migration will change the add_foreign_key method in the schema above to

add_foreign_key "courses", "users", column: "instructor_id"
N.B.: You will need to manually supply the appropriate fields for the belongs_to associations in your model file to enable those associations to find the correct tables.

Important note on the foreign_key modifier
Significantly, the foreign_key modifier is only recognized on columns of type references in a migration. If, for example, you instead declare a column inside your create_table method like this:

t.bigint :instructor_id, null: false, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }
the migration will appear to run successfully, but it will actually ignore the foreign_key modifier. You can verify by checking the schema: it will not have an add_foreign_key "courses", "users", column: "instructor_id" line at the bottom.

In short, if a column's type is not references, then you must use the add_foreign_key method in your migration to set a foreign_key constraint.

Avoiding unnecessary indexes
What if you wanted to make sure that no instructor was added to a course with the same name more than once? You could do this by adding a composite index with unique: true:

add_index :courses [:instructor_id, :name], unique: true
Now you have another problem. Because instructor_id is the first column listed in the composite index, you don't want a separate index on instructor_id. Columns of type references, however, will automatically include an index on that column.

To solve the problem, just use the index: false modifier to tell Rails not to add an index on the instructor-reference column:

# db/migrate/20220518192247_create_courses.rb

class CreateCourses < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
def change
create_table :courses do |t|
t.string :name
t.references :instructor, null: false, foreign_key: true, index: false

      t.timestamps
    end

end
add_index :courses [:instructor_id, :name], unique: true
end
When you run this migration, the only index added will be

t.index ["instructor_id", "name"], name: "index_courses_on_instructor_id_and_name", unique: true
foreign_key constraints
foreign_key constraints in your database ensure referential integrity. In other words, a foreign_key constraint ensures that the foreign keys in that column all link to actual records in the associated table. There can be no broken links (NULL is allowed, however). This is good for your data, and it is a best practice to apply a foreign_key constraint to all of your foreign keys. Nevertheless, this constraint also has some important implications that may not be obvious at first.

Order matters
For starters, foreign_key constraints explain why your migration will crash if you have references designated as foreign_keys to tables that have not yet been created. As this example shows, foreign_key constraints mean that the order in which you create and delete tables and records matters. You therefore have to be careful how you set up your migrations, ensuring that you don't set up references to tables that have not yet been created/migrated.

Destroying tables--e.g., in a seed file--can also run into trouble. Consider the database schema above. A course belongs_to an instructor, which means that an instructor has_many courses. You've already seen that you must accordingly create the users table before you create the courses table. But what will happen if you try to destroy the users table before you destroy the courses table? The operation will produce an error like this:

ActiveRecord::InvalidForeignKey: PG::ForeignKeyViolation: ERROR: update or delete on table "users" violates foreign key constraint "fk_rails_69fe0cadf9" on table "courses"
What's the issue? If you destroy the users table, then every Course will have an invalid instructor_id. The foreign_key constraint on instructor_id in courses will not allow this, so PostgreSQL throws an error on the first deletion that would violate the constraint and rolls back the operation. You must first destroy the courses table; then there will be no objection to destroying the users table.

(A subsequent reading on dependent: :destroy will show how you can automate this destruction process.)

What you've learned
In this reading, you've learned how to use the references column type in a migration to set up a bigint xxxx_id column in your database with an index and a foreign_key constraint. With a model generator, references will also supply the appropriate belongs_to associations in the model file. You also learned how to customize the various references modifiers to produce your desired schema. Finally, you learned about database-level foreign_key constraints: what they do, how and why to implement them, and what potential pitfalls to avoid when you use them.
