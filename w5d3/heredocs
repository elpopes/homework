db.execute(<<-SQL, post_id: post_id)

SQL
In this case, the corresponding value is inserted into the query in place of the symbol :post_id.

What's the difference between using a ? versus a key-value pair? Values bound to the ? are done so positionally. So the first argument passed to a heredoc corresponds to the first ? in your SQL query code.

On the other hand, in key-value pairs the key acts as the placeholder for its corresponding value variable. As a result, the order of key-value pair arguments doesn't matter.

If you use a ? or key-value pair to pass in variables to a SQL query, SQLite3 will help protect against SQL injection attempts by escaping potentially malicious code for you.
