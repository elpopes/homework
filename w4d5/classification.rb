# From fastest to slowest
# O(1) = constant, always run same time (basic addition)
 
# O(log n) = an inverse of an exponent. (b_search)
    # log base 2, if we double input size the steps increase by 1
    # X^2 = b inverse = logx(b) = 2

# O(n) = linear (iterate over entire arrays)

# O(n logn) = log linear (merge sort, quick sort best and avg, best sorting)

# O(n^2) = quadratic nested loops * 2 over an array (bubblesort)

# O(n^k (k has to be greater or equal to 2)) polynomial (quicksort worse case)

# O(2^n) exponential (subsets)

# O(n!) = factorial (permutations)
