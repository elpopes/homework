Database Schemas:
Your database Schema is a description of the oragnization of your database in tables and columns.
Designing your scheme is one ofthe frst and most imporatnt step when writing an application
What data does my application need to function?

Three things to decide when implementing a schema:
What tables will I have
Columns each of those will have
Data type of each of those columns.

Schemas are mutable.

SQL is static typing. Common Data Types
Boolean
Int
Float
VARCHAR(255)
TEXT
DATE
DATETIME
TIME
BLOB

Modeling Relationships
Relationships between entries are modeled through foreign keys:
posts table:

## id | title | body | user_id

1 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 3
2 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 5
3 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 7
4 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 10
5 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 2
6 | 'XXXX' | 'xyz...' | 5

Seach all posts by user_id:

SELECT \*
FROM
posts
WHERE
posts.user_id = 5

Foreign keys are how we model relationships between pieces of data over tables
Ensures data is not duplicated
Posts live in a single place, users in another, and the foreign key (user_id)
in posts expresses the relation between the one and the other.

SQL is a DOMAIN SPECIFIC LANGUAGE (like RSPEC)
sample:

SELECT
name, age, has_cats
FROM
tenants
WHERE
(has_cats = true AND age > 50)

4 Main Data Manipulation Operators
SELECT: retrieve values
INSERT: insert a row
UPDATE: update values
DELETE: bye

SELECT
Structure:

SELECT
one or more columns (or all columns with \*)
FROM
one (or more tables, joined with JOIN)
WHERE
one (or more conditions, joined with AND/OR);
Examples:

SELECT

- FROM
  users
  WHERE
  name = 'Ned';

SELECT
account_number, account_type
FROM
accounts
WHERE
(customer_id = 5 AND account_type = 'checking');

---

INSERT
Structure:

INSERT INTO
table name (column names)
VALUES
(values);
Examples:

INSERT INTO
users (name, age, height_in_inches)
VALUES
('Santa Claus', 876, 34);

INSERT INTO
accounts (account_number, customer_id, account_type)
VALUES
(12345, 76, 'savings');

---

UPDATE
Structure:

UPDATE
table_name
SET
col_name1 = value1,
col_name2 = value2
WHERE
conditions
Examples:

UPDATE
users
SET
name = 'Eddard Stark', house = 'Winterfell'
WHERE
name = 'Ned Stark';

UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance = 30
WHERE
id = 6;

---

DELETE
Structure:

DELETE FROM
table_name
WHERE
conditions
Examples:

DELETE FROM
users
WHERE
(name = 'Eddard Stark' AND house = 'Winterfell');

DELETE FROM
accounts
WHERE
customer_id = 666;

---

Before query define database schema.
Three operators to manipulate database schema

CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE
DROP TABLE

Example of CREATE TABLE:

CREATE TABLE users (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
birth_date DATE,
house VARCHAR(255),
favorite_food VARCHAR(20)
);

---

QUERY ACROSS TABLES:

SELECT
users.name, posts.title
FROM
posts
JOIN
users ON posts.user_id = users.id

SELECT
users.name, posts.title
FROM
posts
JOIN
likes ON posts.id = likes.post_id
JOIN
users ON likes.user_id = users.id
This query will give a list of user names and the posts they have liked.
