So buckets are booty. Maybe hashing is better?
Hashing gets you random garbage of the same length.
highly sensitive, one way
cityhash
crc32 > bittorrent 
murmurhash is used by 
crytographic hashing function 
few collisions. slower 
md5 
5.hash
build hashes in next assignment

Hash set
uses buckets and instead of moding elements, mod the hash but still store the 
element, not the hash.
will have bucket collisions but that's okay. Avoids pathological dataset.
include? 01 0n worsecase but unlikely
insert O1
deletion 01
require "set"
Set.new
oject_id.hash is inherited.s << [] creates a new set.
you need to overright hash and ==.
make your own array map need t create own hash method. Otherwise you won't be able
to find your default empty array with include?
