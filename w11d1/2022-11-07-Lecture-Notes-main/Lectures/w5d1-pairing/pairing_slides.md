### Things to remember

- App academy is NOT a competition
- Half of app academy is coding skills, other half is working collaboratively on a team
- If you feel behind your partner, ask them to slow down and help you
- If you feel ahead of your partner, see if theres anything you can help to explain
- Understanding should be the main goal when working on projects. Completion should never be a priority.

- Gently tell your partner how they could improve
