## Learning Objectives

- Have a process for approaching recursive problems
- Understand what the inductive step is and how to build it
- Know the advantages of memoization 

---

## Lecture Outline

1. Recursion for Today
2. How to think about recursion
3. Coffee Shop example
4. Demos
5. Recursion reasoning tips
6. Kahoot!

---

## What you're _not_ going to do today...

>>>> * Use loops*
>>>> * Modify a method argument
>>>> * Use an optional, private argument
>>>> * Think in linear or procedural terms
>>>> * Be mentally refreshed at the end of the day (sorry)

>>*Recursion & iteration can be used together, so you will use loops but not to recurse.

---

## What you _are_ going to do today...

* Write methods that call themselves
* Break problems down incrementally
* "Trust" that your method already works for all previous cases
* Learn a new way of thinking and programming! &nbsp; :D

---

## What is a recursive function?

* Calls itself ("recurses")
* Solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems
* Has a _**base case**_ â€“ simplest "already solved" condition
* Builds back up incrementally using an _**inductive step**_

---

## Inductive Step
How we use the return value of the previous step to determine the current result.

---

# Coffee Shop Example
How do you know how much coffee you need for everyone in line?

# Final Thoughts
## The Recursion Process
 1. Simplify the problem
 2. Identify the base case
 3. Write the inductive step

---

## Some tips to keep in mind
- Assume what your last recursive call should return  
and build out your inductive step from there
- Use small examples to visualize things
	- one or 2 steps up from the base case
- Look at how you can reduce the input on each call
	- Arrays and Strings: shorten them
  - Integers: decrease or increase to a base case
- Return the same data type (base case and final)

---

## Remember
>>> * You can use Recursion and Iteration _together_
>>> * Each recursive call will return before anything else happens - just like any method call
>>> * Always assume you're getting back the same data type!

## Thanks!
Experiment. Try things. Do it _wrong_. The point isn't to be perfect. It's to _learn_.
