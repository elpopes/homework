# Why JS

web and node

# cool stuff

- Archea
  - logic
  - animation
- paperjs nyan rainbow
  - inteacts with mouse
- retro 3d
  3d functionality
- sneeze the dragon

# chrome dev

- Console
  - console.log("Hello World!")
- testing a lot in chrome dev'
- using for testing
  - allows for functionality
  - web api
  - run in it's entirety

# Ruby v JS

- explicit returns
- one liner arrow functions???
- declare vars
- undeclared are defaulted to global variables
- semicol go after every single statement excepty code blocks
- look up ASI for semicolon insertion
- == vs === ???
  - == performs type conversions
  - 0 == false => true
  - 0 === false => false
- can't use -1 to get last ele (.length - 1 instead)
- 6 falsey values (can use !! to check):

  1. null
  2. undefined
  3. zero or -0
  4. NaN
  5. '' (but not empty arrays)
  6. false

  # String Interpolation

  'hello `hello ${name}`

  - dollar sign and backtiks

  # Var declaration

  temporal deadzone???
  declaration vs initialization???

  - const
    - must init at declartion
  - let
  - var
  - global

  # hoisting

  - with let or const js wil hoist but not init
  - hoisting moves a variable to the top of the code
  - with var will hoist and init
  - what's the dif btwn const and let???

  # Questions

- what's an identifier???

# Datatypes

- arrays and hashes are objects

Primitives are the oother one

1. Boolean
2. Null
3. Undefined
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbols

# Objects

- store in data structures
- functions are objects
- returning a function

# Three types of functions:

1. Named Function
2. Contsructor function
   - creates new object
   - similar to class def
   - instance meths added to protype
3. Annonymous function
   - const feedMe = function(food) {...}

# Invoke functions

1. method style

   - car.drive();

2. function style

   - fundSquareRoot(36);

3. constructor style
   - const restaurant = new Restaurant...

# What is "this"?

- must be called, never implicit

# Callbacks

    - just a function that is passed into ...
    - it's like a proc

# Closure

- inner function always has access to outer function
- can be used to create a private state?

# Debugging

- Have i declared varaibles prop`
- am i returning values
- whats this reference
- do i have semicolons in the ight place?
- am i invoking functions correctly, do I need to be?
