# O(n^2) = {f | f does not dominate n squared}
# description of a set of functions 

# more generalized
# O(g) belongs to the set of functions that do not dominate g.
    # g doesn't dominate g

    # 3n^2 doesn't dominate n^2
    # trying to give closest upper bound as possible

    # O(2n^2) = O(n^2) because they scale in the same way

#rule of simplicity^

# If you use a helper function it's still going to come down to the slowest Big O
