# Why a JS Project?

* Almost every employer uses JavaScript in some form

* An opportunity to extend your JS knowledge and explore some great libraries

* You can make something really pretty with JS/CSS (recruiters love pretty stuff!)

* Supplements your FSP and MERN as another coding example


---

# JS Project Requirements

* No unjustified use of Libraries (No Phaser or jQuery). Do your research and justify your choices. 

* Can be a game, but something original is best 
	* No Tetris, Mario, or any game that was an AA project 

* Can be a data visualization project!(D3)

* Choose something with an appropriate scope (project is due on W10D4 at 4:00pm)

* Must show off front-end skills -- make it pretty

* Must show off JS skills -- make it interactive

# Backend?

* If you are using an external API, sometimes these APIs are not accessible from a browser (CORS-enabled)

* You will need to set up a small backend to reroute your API calls and serve your project. 

* Backend skeleton is on [AAO](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/ch---july-2022-ny-cohort/javascript-project/server-setup)

---

# Scorecard and Grading Rhetoric
* Same scorecard as full stack project - just a different tab! 
* Make a copy and share it with your PM
	* Google sheet > File > Make a copy > Editable for anyone with Link
* Do not make a separate scorecard - just share the same link on InterviewDB

* [scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpc1eArqplVtNakIcgSFHGGEKbFCiRTnOc7d2QUGwW0/edit#gid=80636460)

## Plagirism 

- Taking any code that isn’t yours is plagiarism. I want to be really clear about this. Taking any code that isn’t yours is plagiarism.
    - Any time you take work that isn’t yours and try to pass it off as your own, that constitutes plagiarism.
    - You all signed a contract agreeing to abide by App Academy’s standards of academic integrity. Plagiarism is a very clear violation of that integrity. 
    - App Academy takes plagiarism issues very seriously. Students have been caught plagiarizing in the past. Those students were in violation of their contract with a/A, and consequently were expelled and owed the institution their tuition in full.

# Questions during the project week

* Questions will be moving to the cohort's main Slack channel

* Questions must include in the header `[UNRESOLVED]` for instructors to answer the question

* Add screenshots of error messages and code

* Include description of approaches already attempted to solve the issue

* After question is answered, edit question to say `[RESOLVED]` with the solution

---

# Demo question - Unresolved:

[UNRESOLVED] When I put a debugger into my event handler, I hit it, and I see the data change - but that is not reflected in the render. Where should I look next?

5 SCREENSHOTS!!! Showing code, the weird behavior, the debugger, etc.
There will be a thread where we share resources and chat through the problem

---

# Demo question - Resolved:

_Update the question with the solution and mark resolved_

[RESOLVED] Turns out that I was changing the data into a variable I was not saving, when I saved the variable it was reflected appropriately.

When I put a debugger into my event handler, I hit it, and I see the data change - but that is not reflected in the render. Where should I look next?

5 SCREENSHOTS!!! Showing code, the weird behavior, the debugger, etc.
